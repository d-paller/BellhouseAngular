      We are in the heart of Downtown Shelbyville in a home that was fully
      renovated from 2007-2009 by Bobby and Sue Andriot. If you visit
      "Our Story" page, you can read about the progress that this house has been
      through in the past century.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are striving to be fine dining, but still delight in the "down home
      hospitality" that makes you feel welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no particular dress code; We will take you as you are. Reservations
      are not necessary, but they are accepted and appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Service, Good Food, and a Beautiful Environment...you can't go wrong!
      We look forward to serving you!
